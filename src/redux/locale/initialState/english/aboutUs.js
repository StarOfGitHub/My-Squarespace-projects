  'aboutus.brian.title': 'CEO, Co-Founder',
  'aboutus.brian.blurb': 'Brian Wilson is a extraordinarily passionate guy with a huge heart who loves his family and friends.  Brian is constantly networking with like-minded people and searching for new ways to solve problems, and does so with a unique perspective, which is why he was destined to be an entrepreneur.  Early on, he had a love for electronics and travel which led him to be an Electronics Technician in the US Navy.  After 6 years of service, Brian took a job teaching electronics and communications as a contractor for the Department of the Navy.  It eventually brought him to Japan (where he currently resides with is wife, Megumi) as the Lead Communications Engineer at a training command in Yokosuka where he worked for over 8 years.  Brian was a heavy smoker and turned to vaping to quit in 2013.  His research for the best e-juice sent him on a path to create high quality e-liquids which everyone that tried loved.  As the requests for more juice continued to grow, Brian founded his first business in August of 2014 called VapeSwitch.  VapesSwitch made it easy for people wanting to quit by providing everything needed for someone to make the vape switch from analog cigarettes.  Brian partnered with the best lab in the world called Molecule Labs in California to produce his amazing recipes in the cleanest lab with the best quality ingredients.  Over time it became abundantly clear that the #1 reason for success in quitting smoking with vaping was folks having easy access to high quality e-juice that tastes amazing and contains nicotine.  Being that Japan does not allow the sale of juice containing nicotine within the country, Brian found a way to get e-juice with nicotine from California to Japan faster and cheaper than any method before it.  As such, he left his job and partnered with Tobiah Rex and Co-Founded Nic Juice 2 Japan (NJ2JP) to provide a superior service that makes it easy, fast and affordable for vapers to get their needs met in Japan.',
